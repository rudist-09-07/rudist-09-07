### To whom it may concern,

My role as Nedbank Data Warehouse Executive was to turn around the Nedbank Data Warehouse between 2010 and 2012. The Data Warehouse had been on a journey of non-delivery for 6 years and was in the process of becoming a "white elephant". Rudi Strauss was employed in late 2010 to ensure the end-to-end technical delivery of the Data Warehouse, in the role of Multi Technology Specialist. Rudi played an instrumental role as a trusted advisor, strategically consulting and executing to ensure that we could "technically" win back the business after much faith and business confidence had been lost in the Data Warehouse delivery.

Rudi's contribution, commitment, and dedication to the strategic business success of the NDW were unparalleled with any other staff member. The team constituted between 60 and 80 staff, and Rudi took the lead in addressing the most significant technical challenges that were at play. Rudi is technically astute, emotionally mature, and is able to play at a technical strategic partnership level, for any executive navigating politics in a large-scale corporate organization. Rudi displays integrity, accountability, and stewardship, is very well respected in Nedbank, and is typically known as "the bullet" in the SAS/Data world and community.

Some of Rudi's successes included:

1. The Data Warehouse was not operational for 6 years. Rudi was key in the journey of taking the Data Warehouse from being "moth-balled" to a major business success 2 years after joining.
2. Optimizing a 48-hour data batch window to 6 hours, to enable the overnight batch process required from the business.
3. Rewriting and optimizing the code of what constituted approximately 40% of the total Data Warehouse code, to enable performance and stability.
4. Participated in Proof of Technologies for Ab Initio.
5. Ability to embark on steep learning curves, and add value within a 20-40 hour window of never before having been exposed to a technical problem or technology. Rudi rewrote a key system over one weekend, due to there being long-running issues and reputational risk involved. Rudi had not been exposed to this system prior to that weekend.
6. Being a 100% self-starter, highly motivated team member. In line with agreed technical strategy, Rudi sets himself "Hairy Audacious Goals", and executes on these.
7. Ability to work under exceptional, sustained pressure. I allowed Rudi to work from home after a few months of learning our business, due to the previous points. This model worked very well for all parties.

Rudi was a pleasure to have on our team and was absolutely key to the overall success of the team. Rudi would be an asset to any team that he joins.

Please feel free to contact me for a verbal reference.

**Kind Regards,**

**Reference:** 
I have worked closely with Rudi over the last three years, and he has been the number one factor for the success that was finally achieved in migrating the legacy Nedbank Information Centre to the Nedbank Data Warehouse. Rudi's technical leadership, problem-solving skills, and dedication were key to this success.
